# Face Recognition Improvement Plan

## Objective
Upgrade FRED's face recognition system to use advanced facial embeddings instead of basic size comparisons, enabling more reliable recognition across different angles and distances.

## Key Requirements
1. Replace bounding box size comparison with facial embedding analysis
2. Store and retrieve facial embeddings in the database
3. Maintain recognition consistency across sessions
4. Handle multiple faces with accurate differentiation
5. Optimize for performance with real-time processing

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved recognition accuracy regardless of face position or angle
- Persistent face memory across sessions
- Better handling of multiple individuals
- More robust performance in varied lighting conditions

## Testing Criteria
- Verify recognition from different angles and distances
- Confirm persistence after system restart
- Test accuracy with multiple individuals
- Check performance under various lighting conditions
