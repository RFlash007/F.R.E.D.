# Uploading F.R.E.D.'s Emotion Model to Hugging Face

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for uploading your emotion detection model to the Hugging Face Hub, making it easily accessible and shareable.

## Prerequisites

- Hugging Face account
- Hugging Face API token
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (already installed in your environment):
  - transformers
  - huggingface_hub (updated to latest version)

## Step 1: Create a Hugging Face Account

If you don't already have a Hugging Face account:

1. Go to [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
2. Click "Sign Up" to create an account
3. Complete the registration process

## Step 2: Generate a Hugging Face API Token

1. Log in to your Hugging Face account
2. Go to your profile settings (click on your profile picture â†’ Settings)
3. Navigate to the "Access Tokens" section
4. Click "New token"
5. Give it a meaningful name (e.g., "FRED-Emotion-Upload")
6. Set the appropriate permission level (at least "Write" access)
7. Click "Generate token"
8. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately, as it won't be shown again

## Step 3: Upload Your Model

You have two options to upload your model:

### Option 1: Use Environment Variable (Recommended)

1. Open a PowerShell terminal
2. Set your Hugging Face token as an environment variable:
   ```powershell
   $env:HF_TOKEN = "your_hugging_face_token"
   ```
3. Run the upload script:
   ```powershell
   python upload_emotion_model.py --repo_name "your-username/FRED-emotion-detector"
   ```

### Option 2: Provide Token Directly

Run the script with the token provided as an argument:

```powershell
python upload_emotion_model.py --repo_name "your-username/FRED-emotion-detector" --token "your_hugging_face_token"
```

## Parameters

The script accepts the following parameters:

- `--model_path`: Path to your fine-tuned model (default: `./models/emotion_detector`)
- `--repo_name`: Name for the Hugging Face repository (default: `FRED-emotion-detector`)
  - **Recommendation**: Use your username as a namespace, e.g., `your-username/FRED-emotion-detector`
- `--description`: Brief description of the model (a default is provided)
- `--token`: Your Hugging Face API token (optional if set as environment variable)

## Example Usage

```powershell
python upload_emotion_model.py --repo_name "your-username/FRED-emotion-detector" --description "F.R.E.D.'s emotion detection model fine-tuned for anger, joy, optimism, and sadness detection."
```

## After Uploading

1. The script will create or update a repository on Hugging Face Hub
2. It will upload your model files, tokenizer, and a README
3. Upon successful completion, it will print the URL to your model on Hugging Face

## Using Your Model From Hugging Face

After uploading, you can use your model from anywhere with:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="your-username/FRED-emotion-detector")
result = classifier("I'm excited about this new feature!")
print(f"Emotion: {result[0]['label']}, Confidence: {result[0]['score']:.4f}")
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Error**: Ensure your token has the correct permissions
- **Repository Already Exists**: Use a different repository name or ensure you have write access
- **File Size Issues**: Large models may take some time to upload

## Notes

- The upload process may take several minutes depending on your internet connection speed
- The model will be publicly accessible by default
- You can manage access settings from the Hugging Face website
